# Image Use Authorization

[French version](README_FR.md)

This repository contains 3 forms of image use authorization to be used for individuals appearing in photos and videos taken by Augereau Robin, acting as a Sole Trader for his micro-enterprise.

- The first form is generated using LaTeX and requires a handwritten signature.

- The second form is generated using a Node library.

> The first two versions are stored in the `old` folder.

- The third form is generated and signed from a web page using the Svelte framework.

## Services Offered

The services I offer include:

- Cinematic indoor flights: for advertisements, virtual real estate tours, etc.
- Outdoor flights: for advertisements, event captures, etc.

## Project Evolution

The 3 forms correspond to 3 stages of project development.

- The first is the simplest and most aesthetically pleasing, created in LaTeX. However, regenerating it on a web client is complex.

- The second is generated using a Node library. It serves as a test of the library's capability to generate PDFs.

- The third form, found in the `v3` folder, is a web app made with Svelte that allows for generating and digitally signing the authorization form and applying processing to it.
